# Hey There! ðŸ‘‹

I am a passionate website developer and programmer who uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I am working to go onto fiverr or other businesses to earn money.

# HobbiesðŸŒ±

I have a hobby for speed solving, a competitive sport to solve the Rubikâ€™s cube as fast as you can. My personal best is 8 seconds! Solving the cube makes me relax, and forget about the stressful stuff.

I obviously also have an interest in programming. I usually program websites, but I am looking forward to creating software application development and game simulations.
